Hi, Iâ€™m **Dustin Senos (he/him)**. ðŸ‘‹

A goal to enrich peoplesâ€™ lives through engineering and design has driven me to create digital products for more than a decade.

I spend my days at [The Browser Company of New York](https://thebrowser.company) as a product designer. Weâ€™re building a better browser so your time on the internet is more enjoyable. You should leave your email if youâ€™d like to know when we launch.

Before The Browser Company, I started a [digital product studio](http://www.smallanimalstudios.com) taking on design, product, and prototyping work. Previously, I was the [Head of Design at Medium](https://medium.com), a platform where Barack Obama, Tony Hawk, and everyday people share thoughts and stories. Before Medium, I was a Software Engineer at [Walt Disney](https://disney.com) and oversaw a team of engineers building the game engine for [Club Penguin](https://clubpenguin.com), a virtual world inhabited by millions of children.

To build skill and gain perspective, I take on projects in various verticals that are interesting and challenging. Below is a selection of projects I've worked on:

* Lead a redesign for the [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/04/21/redesigning-we-people) to revamp the We The People platform to increase the quality of submitted petitions.
* Lead the design for the launch of [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/)'s Extra Crunch premium membership.
* Lead the product and design for [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)'s partner dashboard and feedback systems.
* Helped design the first [eero](https://eero.com) (acquired by Amazon) iOS app and onboarding experience.
* Hosted an on-site design sprint for [Figure1](https://figure1.com) to increase user engagement.
* Branded and helped design Talkshow's (acquired by Medium) iOS app.
* Lead the redesign of LaunchKit's (acquired by Google) various tools.
* Co-engineered a social site for [Samsung](https://samsung.com) to accompany a new mobile phone launch.
* Consulted with [Dreamworks](https://dreamworks.com) to suggest improvements for a virtual world.
* Lead the design for [Feminist Frequency](https://twitter.com/femfreq) to improve brand presence and increase donations.
* Lived in the Sierra Nevada Foothills for a month and donated design and product consulting to a [nature conservancy.](https://www.amblethere.com/sierrafoothills-2019)

I also ship personal projects like [Out of Office Hours](https://www.outofofficehours.com), [Wallcat](https://beta.wall.cat), and [LittleIpsum](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/littleipsum/id405772121?mt=12). I have a bit of open source software on [Github](https://github.com/dustinsenos) which I wrote for [Twitter](https://github.com/twitter/ospriet) and [Medium](https://github.com/Medium/matador).

Iâ€™m semi-active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dustin) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/dustin), and publish longer thoughts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dustin). I'm often reading and have recently [listed the books](/books) I'm reading, read, and soon to start.

Various small, ongoing projects:
*   [Sharemark](https://sharemark.co) â€” An email publishing platform.
*   [Articles.page](https://articles.page) â€” An updating list of evergreen articles in response to events at work, such as "I need to setup a career path framework."
*   [Mixtape Songs](http://mixtapesongs.com) â€” Currently a collection of friends' "Favorite ten albums from the last ten years." lists.
